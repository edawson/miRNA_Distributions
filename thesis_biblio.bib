Disturbance of microRNA expression may play a role in the initiation and progression of certain diseases. A microRNA expression signature has been identified that is associated with pancreatic cancer. This has been accomplished with the application of real-time PCR profiling of over 200 microRNA precursors on specimens of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma, paired benign tissue, normal pancreas, chronic pancreatitis and nine pancreatic cancer cell lines. Hierarchical clustering was able to distinguish tumor from normal pancreas, pancreatitis and cell lines. The PAM algorithm correctly classified 28 of 28 tumors, 6 of 6 normal pancreas and 11 of 15 adjacent benign tissues. One hundred microRNA precursors were aberrantly expressed in pancreatic cancer or desmoplasia (p < 0.01), including microRNAs previously reported as differentially expressed in other human cancers (miR-155, miR-21, miR-221 and miR-222) as well as those not previously reported in cancer (miR-376a and miR-301). Most of the top aberrantly expressed miRNAs displayed increased expression in the tumor. Expression of the active, mature microRNA was validated using a real-time PCR assay to quantify the mature microRNA and Northern blotting. Reverse transcription in situ PCR showed that three of the top differentially expressed miRNAs (miR-221, -376a and -301) were localized to tumor cells and not to stroma or normal acini or ducts. Aberrant microRNA expression may offer new clues to pancreatic tumorigenesis and may provide diagnostic biomarkers for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are established regulators of development, cell identity and disease. Although nearly two thousand human miRNA genes are known and new ones are continuously discovered, no attempt has been made to gauge the total miRNA content of the human genome.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Employing an innovative computational method on massively pooled small RNA sequencing data, we report 2,469 novel human miRNA candidates of which 1,098 are validated by in-house and published experiments. Almost 300 candidates are robustly expressed in a neuronal cell system and are regulated during differentiation or when biogenesis factors Dicer, Drosha, DGCR8 or Ago2 are silenced. To improve expression profiling we devised a quantitative miRNA capture system. In a kidney cell system 400 candidates interact with DGCR8 at transcript positions that suggest miRNA hairpin recognition, and 1,000 of the new miRNA candidates interact with Ago1 or Ago2, indicating that they are directly bound by miRNA effector proteins. From kidney cell CLASH experiments, in which miRNA-target pairs are ligated and sequenced, we observe hundreds of interactions between novel miRNAs and mRNA targets. The novel miRNA candidates are specifically but lowly expressed, raising the possibility that not all may be functional. Interestingly, the majority are evolutionarily young and overrepresented in the human brain.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: In summary, we present evidence that the complement of human miRNA genes is substantially larger than anticipated, and that more are likely to be discovered in the future as more tissues and experimental conditions are sequenced to greater depth.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that function by regulating target gene expression posttranscriptionally. They play a critical role in developmental and physiologic processes and are implicated in the pathogenesis of several human diseases including cancer. We examined the expression profiles of 241 human microRNAs in normal tissues and the NCI-60 panel of human tumor-derived cell lines. To quantify microRNA expression, we employed a highly sensitive technique that uses stem-loop primers for reverse transcription followed by real-time PCR. Most microRNAs were expressed at lower levels in tumor-derived cell lines compared with the corresponding normal tissue. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis of microRNA expression revealed four groups among the NCI-60 cell lines consisting of hematologic, colon, central nervous system, and melanoma tumor-derived cell lines clustered in a manner that reflected their tissue of origin. We identified specific subsets of microRNAs that provide candidate molecular signatures characteristic of the tumor-derived cell lines belonging to these four clusters. We also identified specific microRNA expression patterns that correlated with the proliferation indices of the NCI-60 cell lines, and we developed evidence for the identification of specific microRNAs as candidate oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in different tumor types. Our results provide evidence that microRNA expression patterns may mark specific biological characteristics of tumors and/or mediate biological activities important for the pathobiology of malignant tumors. These findings call attention to the potential of microRNAs to provide etiologic insights as well as to serve as both diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for many different tumor types.},

This approach allows for stratification of cancer into informative subtypes by clustering together patients with mutations in similar network regions. We demonstrate NBS in ovarian, uterine and lung cancer cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas. For each tissue, NBS identifies subtypes that are predictive of clinical outcomes such as patient survival, response to therapy or tumor histology. We identify network regions characteristic of each subtype and show how mutation-derived subtypes can be used to train an mRNA expression signature, which provides similar information in the absence of DNA sequence.},

To investigate the influence of miRNAs on transcript levels, we transfected miRNAs into human cells and used microarrays to examine changes in the messenger RNA profile. Here we show that delivering miR-124 causes the expression profile to shift towards that of brain, the organ in which miR-124 is preferentially expressed, whereas delivering miR-1 shifts the profile towards that of muscle, where miR-1 is preferentially expressed. In each case, about 100 messages were downregulated after 12 h. The 3' untranslated regions of these messages had a significant propensity to pair to the 5' region of the miRNA, as expected if many of these messages are the direct targets of the miRNAs. Our results suggest that metazoan miRNAs can reduce the levels of many of their target transcripts, not just the amount of protein deriving from these transcripts. Moreover, miR-1 and miR-124, and presumably other tissue-specific miRNAs, seem to downregulate a far greater number of targets than previously appreciated, thereby helping to define tissue-specific gene expression in humans.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs are major post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. Here we show in the ancient protozoan Giardia lamblia a snoRNA-derived 26-nucleotide microRNA, miR3, which represses the translation of histone H2A mRNA containing an imperfect target but enhances translation when the target is made fully complementary. A stepwise mutational analysis of the fully complementary target showed that the activating effect of miR3 was significantly reduced when a single nucleotide at the 5'-end of the target was altered. The effect of miR3 became repressive when 12 of the nucleotides lost their complementation to miR3 with maximum repression reached when only 8 base-pairs remained between the miR3 seed sequence and the target. A synthetic 8-nucleotide RNA oligomer of the miR3 seed sequence was found capable of exerting a similar Argonaute-dependent translational repression. This is the first report showing a correlation between the extent of base-pairing with the target and a change in miRNA function.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: High-throughput data is providing a comprehensive view of the molecular changes in cancer tissues. New technologies allow for the simultaneous genome-wide assay of the state of genome copy number variation, gene expression, DNA methylation and epigenetics of tumor samples and cancer cell lines. Analyses of current data sets find that genetic alterations between patients can differ but often involve common pathways. It is therefore critical to identify relevant pathways involved in cancer progression and detect how they are altered in different patients. RESULTS: We present a novel method for inferring patient-specific genetic activities incorporating curated pathway interactions among genes. A gene is modeled by a factor graph as a set of interconnected variables encoding the expression and known activity of a gene and its products, allowing the incorporation of many types of omic data as evidence. The method predicts the degree to which a pathway's activities (e.g. internal gene states, interactions or high-level 'outputs') are altered in the patient using probabilistic inference. Compared with a competing pathway activity inference approach called SPIA, our method identifies altered activities in cancer-related pathways with fewer false-positives in both a glioblastoma multiform (GBM) and a breast cancer dataset. PARADIGM identified consistent pathway-level activities for subsets of the GBM patients that are overlooked when genes are considered in isolation. Further, grouping GBM patients based on their significant pathway perturbations divides them into clinically-relevant subgroups having significantly different survival outcomes. These findings suggest that therapeutics might be chosen that target genes at critical points in the commonly perturbed pathway(s) of a group of patients.

abstract = {Measures of RNA abundance are important for many areas of biology and often obtained from high-throughput RNA sequencing methods such as Illumina sequence data. These measures need to be normalized to remove technical biases inherent in the sequencing approach, most notably the length of the RNA species and the sequencing depth of a sample. These biases are corrected in the widely used reads per kilobase per million reads (RPKM) measure. Here, we argue that the intended meaning of RPKM is a measure of relative molar RNA concentration (rmc) and show that for each set of transcripts the average rmc is a constant, namely the inverse of the number of transcripts mapped. Further, we show that RPKM does not respect this invariance property and thus cannot be an accurate measure of rmc. We propose a slight modification of RPKM that eliminates this inconsistency and call it TPM for transcripts per million. TPM respects the average invariance and eliminates statistical biases inherent in the RPKM measure.},

Despite various research efforts on microRNAs, how microRNA target genes are transcriptionally regulated and how the transcriptional regulation of microRNA target genes relates to that of the microRNA genes are not well studied. By investigating the transcriptional regulation of microRNA target genes, we found that different groups of target genes of the same microRNA are co-expressed under different conditions, and these groups rarely overlap with each other for the majority of microRNAs. We also discovered that co-expressed microRNA target genes are often co-regulated, and different groups of target genes of the same microRNA are often regulated differently. In addition, we observed that transcription factors regulating a microRNA gene often regulate its target genes. Our study sheds light on the regulation of microRNA target genes, which will facilitate the prediction of microRNA target genes and the understanding of the transcriptional regulation of microRNA genes. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {microRNAs (miRNAs) are a new class of non-protein-coding, endogenous, small RNAs. They are important regulatory molecules in animals and plants. miRNA regulates gene expression by translational repression, mRNA cleavage, and mRNA decay initiated by miRNA-guided rapid deadenylation. Recent studies show that some miRNAs regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis processes that are important in cancer formation. By using multiple molecular techniques, which include Northern blot analysis, real-time PCR, miRNA microarray, up- or down-expression of specific miRNAs, it was found that several miRNAs were directly involved in human cancers, including lung, breast, brain, liver, colon cancer, and leukemia. In addition, some miRNAs may function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. More than 50\% of miRNA genes are located in cancer-associated genomic regions or in fragile sites, suggesting that miRNAs may play a more important role in the pathogenesis of a limited range of human cancers than previously thought. Overexpressed miRNAs in cancers, such as mir-17-92, may function as oncogenes and promote cancer development by negatively regulating tumor suppressor genes and/or genes that control cell differentiation or apoptosis. Underexpressed miRNAs in cancers, such as let-7, function as tumor suppressor genes and may inhibit cancers by regulating oncogenes and/or genes that control cell differentiation or apoptosis. miRNA expression profiles may become useful biomarkers for cancer diagnostics. In addition, miRNA therapy could be a powerful tool for cancer prevention and therapeutics. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Recent reports that microRNAs (miRNA) may be associated with fragile sites and cancer-associated genomic regions prompted us to investigate whether the PVT1 region on chromosome 8q24 may contain miRNAs. Computational analysis of the genomic sequence covering the PVT1 locus and experimental verification identified seven miRNAs. One miRNA, hsa-miR-1204, resides within a previously described PVT1 exon (1b) that is often fused to the immunoglobulin light chain constant region in vBLs and is present in high copy number in MYC/PVT1-amplified tumors. Like its human counterpart, mouse mmu-miR-1204 represents the closest miRNA to Myc (\~{}50 kb) and is found only 1 to 2 kb downstream of a cluster of retroviral integration sites. Another miRNA, mmu-miR-1206, is close to a cluster of variant translocation breakpoints associated with mouse plasmacytoma and exon 1 of mouse Pvt1. Virtually all the miRNA precursor transcripts are expressed at higher levels in late-stage B cells (including plasmacytoma and vBL cell lines) compared with immature B cells, suggesting possible roles in lymphoid development and/or lymphoma. In addition, lentiviral vector-mediated overexpression of the miR-1204 precursor (human and mouse) in a mouse pre-B-cell line increased expression of Myc. High levels of expression of the hsa-miR-1204 precursor is also seen in several epithelial cancer cell lines with MYC/PVT1 coamplification, suggesting a potentially broad role for these miRNAs in tumorigenesis.},

abstract = {Using the technique of mRNA-cDNA hybridization, we have shown that there are between 11,500 and 12,500 different mRNAs in three different mouse tissues:kidneys, brains, and livers. Several experiments suggest that in each tissue the mRNAs are organized into three abundance classes rather than as a continumm with respect to concentration. Cross-hybridization experminets show that the most abundant class of mRNA in each tissue is characteristic, and that a high proportion of the total sequences are common between tissues. For a more complete analysis, cDNA was fractionated into three classes. Studies using isolated abundant cDNA show that some abundant sequences of liver and kidney are present in other tissues, but among the lower frequency classes. Thus tissue-specific differences in mRNA populations may be related to abundance as well as qualitative differences. Using isolated middle frequency cDNA of the kidney, it was shown that of the 550 or so sequences in this class, approximately 500 are shared with the liver. Similarly, between 9,500 and 10,500 of the low frequency kidney cDNAs are shared with the brain and liver, respectively, suggesting that the majority of mRNAs may be involved with "housekeeping" activities. In an attempt to see whether abundance of mRNA is related to repetition of the sequence in the genome, it was shown that abundant and middle frequency cDNA of the liver and kidney contain a component that anneals with DNA repeated approximately 100 fold. However, the low frequency cDNA of the kidney contains no repeated sequences.},

Thanks to improved analytical methods, accurate and extensive quantitative measurements can now be made of the mRNA, protein and metabolite from biological systems. Here, we report a large-scale analysis of the population abundance distributions of the transcriptomes, proteomes and metabolomes from varied biological systems. RESULTS: We compared the observed empirical distributions with a number of distributions: power law, lognormal, loglogistic, loggamma, right Pareto-lognormal (PLN) and double PLN (dPLN). The best-fit for mRNA, protein and metabolite population abundance distributions was found to be the dPLN. This distribution behaves like a lognormal distribution around the centre, and like a power law distribution in the tails. To better understand the cause of this observed distribution, we explored a simple stochastic model based on geometric Brownian motion. The distribution indicates that multiplicative effects are causally dominant in biological systems. We speculate that these effects arise from chemical reactions: the central-limit theorem then explains the central lognormal, and a number of possible mechanisms could explain the long tails: positive feedback, network topology, etc. Many of the components in the central lognormal parts of the empirical distributions are unidentified and/or have unknown function. This indicates that much more biology awaits discovery.},

abstract = {The parts of the genome transcribed by a cell or tissue reflect the biological processes and functions it carries out. We characterized the features of mammalian tissue transcriptomes at the gene level through analysis of RNA deep sequencing (RNA-Seq) data across human and mouse tissues and cell lines. We observed that roughly 8,000 protein-coding genes were ubiquitously expressed, contributing to around 75\% of all mRNAs by message copy number in most tissues. These mRNAs encoded proteins that were often intracellular, and tended to be involved in metabolism, transcription, RNA processing or translation. In contrast, genes for secreted or plasma membrane proteins were generally expressed in only a subset of tissues. The distribution of expression levels was broad but fairly continuous: no support was found for the concept of distinct expression classes of genes. Expression estimates that included reads mapping to coding exons only correlated better with qRT-PCR data than estimates which also included 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). Muscle and liver had the least complex transcriptomes, in that they expressed predominantly ubiquitous genes and a large fraction of the transcripts came from a few highly expressed genes, whereas brain, kidney and testis expressed more complex transcriptomes with the vast majority of genes expressed and relatively small contributions from the most expressed genes. mRNAs expressed in brain had unusually long 3'UTRs, and mean 3'UTR length was higher for genes involved in development, morphogenesis and signal transduction, suggesting added complexity of UTR-based regulation for these genes. Our results support a model in which variable exterior components feed into a large, densely connected core composed of ubiquitously expressed intracellular proteins.},

abstract = {Schizophrenia is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder that involves disturbances in neural circuitry and synaptic function. The exquisite network architecture and capacity for discreet post-synaptic remodeling of neurons requires coordination by an elaborate intracellular network of molecular signal transduction systems. The redundancy of these networks means that many combinations of gene variants have the potential to cause system dysfunction that manifest as related neurobehavioural syndromes. Recent investigation has revealed that posttranscriptional gene regulation and associated small non-coding microRNA (miRNA), are likely to be important factors shaping the topography of these networks. miRNA display complex temporospatial expression patterns in the mammalian brain and have the potential to regulate thousands of target genes by functioning as the specificity factor for intracellular gene-silencing machinery. They are emerging as key regulators of many neurodevelopmental and neurological processes as their dysregulation could lead to pervasive changes in the network structure during development and in the mature brain that are highly significant in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. This review looks at mounting evidence that mature miRNA levels are altered in both the cerebral cortex and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in schizophrenia. It also examines compelling evidence that the underlying miRNA biogenesis machinery and miRNA genes themselves are subject to disease-associated genetic mutation and epigenetic influence. Significantly, these changes in miRNA expression and associated machinery may represent new targets for pharmaceutical development, and the identification of miRNA signatures in PBMCs suggest that miRNA biomarkers of schizophrenia may also provide the basis for new clinical diagnostics. These developments have tremendous potential and highlight the significance of this avenue of research. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},
